RETURNS

----

We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving the service to request a return:
To analyze your data, the HEMO-AI service uses Artificial Intelligence technologies. To use this service, you must register and fill out a special form.
After filling it out, a form for making a payment will appear. All payments are made through a secure platform to ensure the safety of your financial data.
Send a request to the AI, and you will receive a detailed response with analysis results.
If no response from the AI is provided at all, you have the right to a refund for services provided within 30 days.

For any questions regarding returns, you can always contact us at admin@hemo-ai.kz.

If more than 15 business days have passed since your return was approved, please contact us at admin@hemo-ai.kz.
